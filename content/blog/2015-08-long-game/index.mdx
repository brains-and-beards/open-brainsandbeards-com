Hi, it’s Patryk and Wojciech. We’ve just started a development shop. There are many like it, but this one is ours. And it reflects what we believe in. So, what do we actually believe in? I’m glad you asked!

Well, the motto we want to live by is „**if it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing well**”. We’re focused on quality in everything we spend our time on. Life’s too short to work on mediocre products. That’s why we choose to work with people who share our values.

When you approach us with your product idea we’ll sit down together and help you pinpoint your vision and translate it into a product and a set of features. We’ll enrich your idea with our years of experience in delivering software products. Then we’ll implement it with your supervision in weekly iterations that allow fast feedback. At the end, if you want to hire a permanent team to take over, we’ll even help you choose them.

We believe in more than an MVP, we build [Minimum Lovable Products](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wfm5iN0qGlM). We don’t want to stop at offering a product that kind-of works and solves a problem. We want it also to be a joy to use and beautiful. We want your users to enjoy their interaction with technology. We want you to be proud of what we created together.

The last, but not least, reason why we started this company is that **we believe in sustainable development and living sustainable lives**. We think that having a clear head and good work-life balance leads to more productive and creative work.

If you share our values, don’t hesitate to [reach out](/contact-us). I’m sure we’d love to work with you!

This post is a follow-up to [Don't Re-Render All FlatList Items](/blog/2022-dont-rerender-all-flatlist-items). In the previous article, we optimized FlatList to prevent unnecessary re-renders when updating list item values. This time, weâ€™ll tackle another common issue: avoiding re-renders when adding or removing items.

Many developers believe they need to wrap every FlatList prop in `useCallback` or `useMemo` to optimize performance. But is that really necessary? Letâ€™s find out.

This issue is especially common in apps with infinite scrolling or pagination, where new items are fetched and added to a list dynamically. If your app uses `onEndReached` to fetch new pages from an API, the same principles apply.

## The Problem: Every Item Re-Renders When Adding a New One

Imagine an app that fetches data from the internet and appends new items to a FlatList. Hereâ€™s what we'd expect:

- New items render when added
- Existing items do not re-render (since they havenâ€™t changed)

But in many cases, all items re-render when a new one is added!

### Let's See It in Action

Hereâ€™s an [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/@sakydpozrux/rerender-only-changed-items) where all items re-render when we add a new one. You'll edit it yourself later!

<div class="gif-container">

An example app where items are added and removed.

</div>


How to test:
- Open the console logs in your browser
- Click "Add Item" and check the logs
- Notice that every existing item re-renders, even though they havenâ€™t changed!

<div class="gif-container">

Hereâ€™s what happens in the console when adding items in the unoptimized version.

</div>

Example console output:
```
Rendering item: 1
Rendering item: 2
Rendering item: 1  <- Why is this rendering again?
Rendering item: 2
Rendering item: 3  <- Only this one is new
Rendering item: 1
Rendering item: 2
Rendering item: 3
```

### Why FlatList Thinks Everything Changed

When we add a new item to the list, we expect only that new item to render. However, FlatList ends up re-rendering all items. Why does this happen? The issue comes from how React handles state updates.

In our app, the FlatListâ€™s `data` prop is an array of `ids`. We're working with immutable data, which means we donâ€™t modify an existing array to add a new elements. Instead, we create a new array with the updated data. That means that whenever we add a new item, `ids` gets a brand new array reference. Even though the contents of `ids` are almost the same (except for the new item), FlatList sees a completely new array it should render.

### How This Triggers a Full Re-Render

1. The user clicks "Add Item", triggering a state update.
2. We create a new `ids` array that includes the new item.
3. The ListScreen component re-renders because it subscribes to Redux state.
4. FlatList receives a new value for the `data` prop (even though most items are unchanged).
5. FlatList re-renders all items, because it thinks the whole list has changed.

This isnâ€™t a bug â€” FlatList is simply reacting to the updated state as intended. Fortunately, we donâ€™t need to change how FlatList works. Instead, we can stop unnecessary re-renders by making a small tweak in how we define our list items.


## The Fix: Just Add React.memo

Hereâ€™s the best part: the fix is incredibly simple. Wrap `ListItem` in `React.memo`. Thatâ€™s it.

Now, `ListItem` will only re-render when its props change. Since it only takes an `id` and they remain the same, old items wonâ€™t re-render when a new one is added.

### Console Output After the Fix
```
Rendering item: 1
Rendering item: 2
Rendering item: 3  <- Only new items render now!
```

<div class="gif-container">

![Logs after optimization - only new items render](flatlist-logs-after.gif)

After the fix, only new items render as expected.

</div>

Boom! No more unnecessary re-renders. Now, only new items render when added while existing ones stay untouched. ðŸŽ‰

### What Does Actually Happen?

`FlatList` still calls `renderItem` for each item, but `React.memo` prevents actual re-renders unless the itemâ€™s props changed.


## Do I Still Need useCallback?

Letâ€™s modify the example by adding a timer at the top of the screen that updates every second, showing the current time (`hh:mm:ss`). This change will cause the entire component to re-render every second, which will also re-render every FlatList item unnecessarily.

### Timer Example

```tsx
const [time, setTime] = React.useState(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
React.useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    setTime(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
  }, 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

This makes all items re-render every second! ðŸš¨

This happens because the parent component re-renders and creates a new instance of `renderItem`. This means `FlatList` receives a new prop and re-renders all items.

### The Fix: Wrapping Callbacks in `useCallback`

To fix this, we need to wrap `renderItem` and `keyExtractor` in `useCallback`. This ensures those functions stay the same (not just in terms of what they _do_, but also in terms of what they _are_) across renders, so no new unnecessary props.

```tsx
keyExtractor={React.useCallback((id) => id, [])}
renderItem={React.useCallback(({ item: id }) => <ListItem id={id} />, [])}
```

Alternatively, we can define them outside the component function or omit `keyExtractor`, since `id => id` is the default behavior.


### Better Architecture: Separating Components

A better approach is to extract the clock into its own component. This keeps state updates isolated, preventing unnecessary re-renders.

```tsx
const Clock = () => {
  const [time, setTime] = React.useState(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setTime(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);
  return <Text style={{ fontSize: 18, fontWeight: "bold" }}>Current time: {time}</Text>;
};
```

By using `<Clock />` inside `ListScreen`, only the clock updates, keeping FlatList untouched. This is a better architectural choice because it:
- isolates responsibilities (the clock only manages time)
- prevents unnecessary re-renders in unrelated components
- makes code more maintainable

## Note on FlashList

[FlashList](https://shopify.github.io/flash-list/) takes a different approach to optimizing re-renders and some of these techniques might not be necessary. We wonâ€™t cover FlashList in this post, but itâ€™s an alternative worth exploring. Let me know if youâ€™d like a separate post about it!

## Final Thoughts

We saw how FlatList re-renders all items when new ones are added even when it's not neceÄ…ry. By making a simple tweak (`React.memo`), we prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve performance with minimal effort.

If you use FlatList in your app, I encourage you to test whether your list items are re-rendering more than necessary. A small optimization can make a huge difference in performance â€” especially on lower-end devices. ðŸš€

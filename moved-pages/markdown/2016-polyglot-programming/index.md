Recently, Wojciech spoke at the [PolyConf 15](http://polyconf.com/) conference about polyglot programming. We think that we’re all just developers and constraining ourselves into frontend, backend or mobile roles is limiting. The talk is about how to make sure you’re improving yourcraft on a daily basis and not being stuck working on the same stuff day after day.

Also, how Amazon Indians refer to polyglot programming, animated gifs and niche jokes. Interested? Check it for yourself!

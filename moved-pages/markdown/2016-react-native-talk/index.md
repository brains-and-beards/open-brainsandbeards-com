Last week we (by means of Wojtek’s body) gave a talk on cross platform mobile app development using React Native. It’s an exciting new framework that let’s you write applications for iOS, Android, and even (since recently) Windows phone! That means a possibility to share code (which means cutting costs and development time), without having to settle for the subpar experience of hybrid applications.

As we’ve already been working with this technology we wanted to share the lessons that we’ve learnt by now. We discussed both the business advantages of using it and the developer experience. However, the main focus was 100% pragmatic: can I use it to create cool stuff already?

The answer is a cautionary yes, as it depends a lot on the exact product you’re aiming to build. It’s a long story (it did take 30 minutes to answer it fully!) and if you’re interested, we’d be happy to talk whether it makes sense for your project in particular, just [drop us a line](mailto:hi@brainsandbeards.com) and we’ll get back to you.

Also, if you’re from Barcelona and interested in this upcoming mobile development revolution, join our latest initiative: [React Native Barcelona meetup](http://www.meetup.com/React-Native-Barcelona/). We have some cool stuff coming up!

Meanwhile, you can take a look at the slides from the event: [Cross Platform Mobile Development with React Native](https://speakerdeck.com/sharnik/cross-platform-mobile-development-with-react-native).

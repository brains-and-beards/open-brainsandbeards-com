Thanks for checking-in to part three of my blog series **Getting Started with GraphQL and React Native.** Now that we have all the configuration out of the way, Iâ€™ll walk you through how to create and update data using GraphQL and whatâ€™s called a _Mutation_.

#### Create aÂ form

In most apps where you can create and update data, you do so via a form. For the purposes of this example, weâ€™ll create a simple form that will ask the user for a dog name and type.

Create a simple layout and add some `<TextInput>` components, similar to the following example:

```javascript {numberLines: true}
<View>
  <Text style={styles.welcome}>Dogs data:</Text>

  <TextInput
    style={styles.input}
    onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({ name: text })}
    value={this.state.name}
    placeholder="name/>

        <TextInput
        style={styles.input}
        onChangeText={text => this.setState({ type: text })}
        value={this.state.type}
        placeholder="
    type
  />

  <Button onPress={() => {}} title="Add dog" />
</View>
```

#### Execute a mutation operation

Now we need to create a mutation for adding a dog. You donâ€™t need to create anything extra on the server-side. Prisma already offers you mutations to create data based on the types in your GraphQL schema. You can test the mutation by opening the Prisma endpoint in your browser:

In my example, I used the `createDog` mutation and named the operation `addDog`. When executing a mutation, more times than not youâ€™ll want to send along some user data. This is done through variables.

To verify the operation is executed successfully, copy the same mutation from above and click the _Play_ button. If successful, youâ€™ll notice the mutation returns an `id`. Thatâ€™s because weâ€™ve specified we want the `id` of the new dog returned in our mutation.

Letâ€™s add the `addDog` mutation to our React Native app:

```javascript {numberLines: true}
const addDog = gql`
  mutation addDog($type: String!, $name: String!) {
    createDog(data: { type: $type, name: $name }) {
      id
    }
  }
`
```

Okay, we also need to import `Mutation` from the `react-apollo` package.

```javascript {numberLines: true}
import { ApolloProvider, graphql, Mutation } from 'react-apollo'
```

To execute a mutation operation in a React Native app, we use the `Mutation` component. It takes a _mutation_ prop, which is where weâ€™ll assign our _addDog_ mutation. The `Mutation` component uses the [render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) pattern in React. React will call the render prop function and provide you with a mutate function and an object containing data about the mutationâ€™s result. To use the `Mutation` component, we wrap our existing layout in it:

```javascript {numberLines: true}
render() {
    return (
      <ApolloProvider client={client}>
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <Mutation mutation={addDog} refetchQueries={[{ query: dogQuery }]}>
            {(addDogMutation, { data }) => (
              <View>
                <Text style={styles.welcome}>Dogs data:</Text>
                <TextInput
                  style={styles.input}
                  onChangeText={text => this.setState({ name: text })}
                  value={this.state.name}
                  placeholder="name"
                />
                <TextInput
                  style={styles.input}
                  onChangeText={text => this.setState({ type: text })}
                  value={this.state.type}
                  placeholder="type"
                />
                <Button
                  onPress={() => {
                    addDogMutation({
                      variables: {
                        type: this.state.type,
                        name: this.state.name
                      }
                    })
                      .then(res => res)
                      .catch(err => <Text>{err}</Text>);
                    this.setState({ type: '', name: '' });
                  }}
                  title="Add dog"
                />
              </View>
            )}
          </Mutation>
          <Text style={styles.welcome}>My dogs:</Text>
          <DogComponent />
        </View>
      </ApolloProvider>
    );
  }
```

We want to ensure our list of dogs is updated automatically after each successful mutation. For that to happy we can pass a `refetchQueries` prop to the `Mutation` component. It takes an array of objects, where youâ€™d specify the queries you want to re-execute.

```
<Mutation mutation={addDog} refetchQueries={[{ query: dogQuery }]}>
```

Look at the buttonâ€™s `onPress` method, we call the `addDogMutation` with variables, very similar to how it was done in the in the playground.

> Itâ€™s very useful to first check your mutations are working correctly in the playground because you can save a lot of time. Especially if you have a bug! Trust me, I knowâ€¦ ðŸ˜‚

Here is the final result of our app, where we can add a new dog:

#### Whatâ€™s next

I hope this article has encouraged you to learn more about GraphQL [mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/queries) and how they work in Apollo Client. But, our adventure with GraphQL, Apollo, and Prisma doesnâ€™t stop here. In the next article, weâ€™ll focus on **Implementing Authentication and integrating it with Apollo Client.** If you like our tutorials, remember to follow us on Medium and check out our next post. ðŸ˜ƒ

              Above you saw a few words about each of us, but what's important
              are the qualities we all share. Here are a few traits that we
              consider vital:

                <p>
                  Our business revolves around building products in three
                  different technologies: iOS, Android, and React Native.
                  Because we value both the strong foundation of native mobile
                  development and the versatility of cross-platform solutions,
                  most of us are comfortable with at least two of them.

              <PictureListItem image={reliabilityIcon} title="Reliability">
                <p>
                  Working remotely we all need to be able to self-manage,
                  recognize what the priorities arem and focus our work on
                  what's most important. Being responsible and taking ownership
                  of our work is key for us.

                <p>
                  Monocultural teams create boring and one-sided products.
                  That's not us. Instead, we strive to create depth that comes
                  from combining different points of view. Currently we're seven
                  developers spread over four countries all over Europe and
                  we're not stopping there.
